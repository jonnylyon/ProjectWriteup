abstract = {We consider the problem of optimally parking empty cars in an elevator group so as to anticipate and intercept the arrival of new passengers and minimize their waiting times. Two solutions are proposed, for the down-peak and up-peak traffic patterns. We demonstrate that matching the distribution of free cars to the arrival distribution of passengers is sufficient to produce savings of up to 80\% in down-peak traffic. Since this approach Is not useful for the much harder case of up-peak traffic, we propose a solution based on the representation of the elevator system as a Markov decision process (MDP) model with relatively few aggregated states, and determination of the optimal parking policy by means of dynamic programming on the MDP model.},

@incollection{Cassandras2006,
abstract = {Th is chapter explores a new approach to elevator dispatching based on a formal hybrid system model in conjunction with a receding horizon controller. Elevator dispatching is a combinatorially hard problem with many control constraints, time-varying traffic patterns, partial state information, and random effects. In an elevator system, the “dispatcher” is a centralized, upper-level controller that determines where each car is to stop, either to load passengers or to unload them. Effective elevator dispatching must meet certain quality-of service criteria and gives rise to a problem of great practical importance that remains open because of several difficulties. A multi-car elevator system is a hybrid system that combines the time-driven motion dynamics of the cars with the event-driven dynamics imposed by the dispatching controller.},

@article{Crites1998,
abstract = {Recent algorithmic and theoretical advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have attracted widespread interest. RL algorithms have appeared that approximate dynamic programming on an incremental basis. They can be trained on the basis of real or simulated experiences, focusing their computation on areas of state space that are actually visited during control, making them computationally tractable on very large problems. If each member of a team of agents employs one of these algorithms, a new collective learning algorithm emerges for the team as a whole. In this paper we demonstrate that such collective RL algorithms can be powerful heuristic methods for addressing large-scale control problems. Elevator group control serves as our testbed. It is a difficult domain posing a combination of challenges not seen in most multi-agent learning research to date. We use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reward signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of multi-agent RL on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem of practical utility},

The main discussion and calculations should be considered as a further development of the three passages concept. To achieve better global performance of the EGC system, especially to reduce hall call waiting time, a calculation methodology of car kinematics is presented. The importance of detailed kinematics considerations is demonstrated with data taken from a real high-speed EGC system in 63-floor building in Seoul, Korea.},

abstract = {The scheduling algorithm is applied to elevator group for the optimal scheduling with different traffic mode, which will improve the performance of elevator group control system. The fuzzy C-mean (FCM) algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to identify the traffic mode of elevator. The iterative process based on gradient descent in FCM algorithm is replaced by PSO algorithm, which makes the global search capability become stronger. Meanwhile the sensitivity to initial value of the FCM algorithm is decreased. And the realization process of the algorithm is given. The data of elevator traffic flow are collected from some office building, which is made up of test sample. The elevator traffic flow is classified by using the algorithm proposed. Compared with the FCM clustering algorithm, the results show that FCM algorithm based on PSO have better adaptability and better effect, and the recognition of elevator traffic mode is realized.},

abstract = { We present an efficient algorithm for exact calculation and minimization of expected waiting times of all passengers using a bank of elevators. The dynamics of the system are represented by a discrete-state Markov chain embedded in the continuous phase-space diagram of a moving elevator car. The chain is evaluated efficiently using dynamic programming to compute measures of future system performance such as expected waiting time, properly averaged over all possible future scenarios. A linear-time elevator group controller based on this method significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms and is completely within the computational capabilities of contemporary elevator bank controllers.},

@article{Pepyne1997,
abstract = {In this paper we develop optimal dispatching controllers for
elevator systems during uppeak traffic. An uppeak traffic period arises
when the bulk of the passenger traffic is moving from the first door up
into the building (e.g., the start of a business day in an office
building). The cars deliver the passengers and then return empty to the
first floor to pick up more passengers. We show that the structure of
the optimal dispatching policy minimizing the discounted or average
passenger waiting time is a threshold-based policy. That is, the optimal
policy is to dispatch an available car from the first floor when the
number of passengers inside the car reaches or exceeds a threshold that
depends on several factors including the passenger arrival rate,
elevator performance capabilities, and the number of elevators available
at the first floor. Since most elevator systems have sensors to
determine the car locations and the number of passengers in each car,
such a threshold policy is easily implemented. Our analysis is based on
a Markov decision problem formulation with a batch service queueing
model consisting of a single queue served by multiple finite-capacity
bulk servers. We use dynamic programming techniques to obtain the
structure of the optimal control policy and to derive some of its
important properties. Several numerical examples are included to
illustrate our results and to compare the optimal threshold policy to
some known ad hoc approaches. Finally, since many transportation systems
can be modeled as multiserver batch service queueing systems, we expect
our results to be useful in controlling those systems as well},
