abstract = {Th is chapter explores a new approach to elevator dispatching based on a formal hybrid system model in conjunction with a receding horizon controller. Elevator dispatching is a combinatorially hard problem with many control constraints, time-varying traffic patterns, partial state information, and random effects. In an elevator system, the “dispatcher” is a centralized, upper-level controller that determines where each car is to stop, either to load passengers or to unload them. Effective elevator dispatching must meet certain quality-of service criteria and gives rise to a problem of great practical importance that remains open because of several difficulties. A multi-car elevator system is a hybrid system that combines the time-driven motion dynamics of the cars with the event-driven dynamics imposed by the dispatching controller.},

abstract = {This paper describes the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to the difficult real world problem of elevator dispatching. The elevator domain poses a combination of challenges not seen in most RL research to date. Elevator systems operate in continuous state spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic systems. Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of RL on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimiz...},

abstract = {The scheduling algorithm is applied to elevator group for the optimal scheduling with different traffic mode, which will improve the performance of elevator group control system. The fuzzy C-mean (FCM) algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to identify the traffic mode of elevator. The iterative process based on gradient descent in FCM algorithm is replaced by PSO algorithm, which makes the global search capability become stronger. Meanwhile the sensitivity to initial value of the FCM algorithm is decreased. And the realization process of the algorithm is given. The data of elevator traffic flow are collected from some office building, which is made up of test sample. The elevator traffic flow is classified by using the algorithm proposed. Compared with the FCM clustering algorithm, the results show that FCM algorithm based on PSO have better adaptability and better effect, and the recognition of elevator traffic mode is realized.},

@article{Pepyne1997,
abstract = {In this paper we develop optimal dispatching controllers for
elevator systems during uppeak traffic. An uppeak traffic period arises
when the bulk of the passenger traffic is moving from the first door up
into the building (e.g., the start of a business day in an office
building). The cars deliver the passengers and then return empty to the
first floor to pick up more passengers. We show that the structure of
the optimal dispatching policy minimizing the discounted or average
passenger waiting time is a threshold-based policy. That is, the optimal
policy is to dispatch an available car from the first floor when the
number of passengers inside the car reaches or exceeds a threshold that
depends on several factors including the passenger arrival rate,
elevator performance capabilities, and the number of elevators available
at the first floor. Since most elevator systems have sensors to
determine the car locations and the number of passengers in each car,
such a threshold policy is easily implemented. Our analysis is based on
a Markov decision problem formulation with a batch service queueing
model consisting of a single queue served by multiple finite-capacity
bulk servers. We use dynamic programming techniques to obtain the
structure of the optimal control policy and to derive some of its
important properties. Several numerical examples are included to
illustrate our results and to compare the optimal threshold policy to
some known ad hoc approaches. Finally, since many transportation systems
can be modeled as multiserver batch service queueing systems, we expect
our results to be useful in controlling those systems as well},
